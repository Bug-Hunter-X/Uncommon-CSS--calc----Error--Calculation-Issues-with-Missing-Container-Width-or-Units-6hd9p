The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `calc()` function:  .element { width: calc(100% - 10px); }  This code intends to make the element's width 10 pixels less than its container's width. However, if the container's width is not explicitly set, the `calc()` function might not produce the expected result. This usually happens because the browser cannot evaluate the calculation without a defined container width.  Another example is when a unit is missing.  For example, writing calc(100% - 10) will fail since a unit like px or em is missing from 10. This will cause the width not to be properly set, and depending on the context, the element might appear as a narrow line, or worse, not be visible at all.
